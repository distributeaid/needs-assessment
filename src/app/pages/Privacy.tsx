				<h2 className="mt-4">What data do we collect?</h2>
				<p>Distribute Aid collects the following data:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Distribute Aid only collects the data you choose to provide when
						filling out the Needs Assessment form.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<ul>
					<li>
						This includes information such as your email address, organisation
						name, the region you operate in, location (as you choose to share
						it), size and type of storage space, and information about your
						services and needs as you choose to share it.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Distribute Aid does not collect any data from its form or website
						visitors through cookies.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h2 className="mt-4">How do we collect your data?</h2>
				<p>
					You directly provide Distribute Aid with all of the data we collect.
					We collect data and process data when you:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Voluntarily fill out a needs assessment form in part or in full.
					</li>
					<li>
						Voluntarily provide us with information through other means such as
						WhatsApp and email, related to your group’s needs.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h2 className="mt-4">How will we use your data?</h2>
				<p>
					The goal of this project is to make the best possible aid available
					for people who access your services. The results from this survey will
					allow Distribute Aid to understand your region’s and organisation’s
					needs over the next three months so that we can advise collection
					groups on what to collect, figure out which targeted campaigns to run,
					and decide who to reach out to for in-kind donations. In short, this
					assessment helps make sure the aid you receive is better suited to
					your needs.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you agree, Distribute Aid will share your data with our other
					partner groups so you can organise collaboration where relevant. For
					example, where your needs and another group’s overstock or new
					incoming donations align so an aid exchange would be beneficial for
					both parties. We will always contact you and ask for permission in
					each circumstance before sharing any identifying information.
				</p>
				<p>
					Distribute Aid will also use the data provided to update our Customer
					Relationship Management System (CRM) data, which is hosted by Notion.
					This information will then be used to contact you (email address), and
					for the purpose of planning donations of aid (e.g. your storage
					space).
				</p>
				<p>
					You are under no statutory or contractual requirement or obligation to
					provide Distribute Aid with personal data and there are no possible
					legal consequences of failing to provide your personal data.
				</p>
				<h2 className="mt-4">How do we store your data?</h2>
				<p>
					Distribute Aid securely stores your data in Clever Cloud, Google Suite (Gmail,
					Sheets, Docs), Prezi, Qualtrics, Notion, and Contentful. Access to
					these platforms is only available to relevant Distribute Aid
					volunteers who have signed an agreement in line with our privacy
					terms. This access is granted through a two-ste p authentication
					password management system.
				</p>
				<p>
					Distribute Aid will keep your identifying data (any data that would
					link your responses to your group) for a period of 24 months . Once
					this time period has expired, we will delete your data by deleting the
					form submissions containing any personal data in the survey tools (G
					oogle services , Q ualtrics) and removing your compiled responses from
					our google sheets and Notion pages.
				</p>
				<p>
					Distribute Aid will keep regional data containing information about
					overall trends in needs (without being able to link that information
					to a particular group’s responses) indefinitely unless asked to delete
					it within 24 months of providing the data.
				</p>
				<h2 className="mt-4">Marketing</h2>
				<p>
					Distribute Aid will not use any of your information for marketing
					purposes. Nor will we share it with partner companies for marketing
					purposes.
				</p>
