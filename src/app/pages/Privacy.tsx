					Distribute Aid WILL NOT share individual survey responses with any
					other group or to the general public. We WILL provide you with a copy
					of your survey response(s), and you can choose to share that as you
					wish. Distribute Aid DOES NOT make decisions on where collection
					groups should send their aid, we only share open offers with frontline
					groups who decide together who gets what. We WILL use individual
					responses to compute regional needs and use both of these to increase
					the efficiency of our own efforts and highlight gaps before they
					happen. Our website team WILL show a public interactive summary of the
					combined needs for each region on our website, so that everyone can
					use it as they wish. Our website WILL NOT show any individual group's
					individual information or data. We will process your data in Google
					Drive. The data for the public summary of regional needs will be
					stored in Contentful, and hosted with the rest of our website on
					Netlify.
